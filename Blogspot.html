	<p>Technology is on the rise and us humans are not even noticing! Robots are starting to take over alot of mannual labor jobs because they are much stonger and can work way longer and more efficient than humans. If robot progress keeps getting better, in no time the robots will take over most of the human jobs. Thes robots are getting so advanced that they can teach themselfs how to do new tasks! If they keep getting smarter they will eventually overthrow the human race!</p>

		<p>Robots won't take over the human race because they are only machines, and a machine that replicates a human to the fine details won't be around for a while. Terminators won't be taking over humans. I can see how robots could become smart enough to not need a human master, but I think we can keep robots under control. Nice background</p>

		<p> Your mama is right. We shouldn't be too attatched to technology because it makes us stupid. Don't be stupid. Also, robots will take over the world one day so we should be careful to not rely on technology so much. Good Job.</p>
